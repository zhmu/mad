At the beginning of the file one 64 byte header

This will be followed by 256 bytes. They indicate each chars height and width.
When the height or width is zero, the char is not used. The HI NIBBLE is the
height and the LO NIBBLE is the width.

After this will come the font data, encoded in BITS. A bit will indicate a dot
needs to be drawn, otherwise it will not be drawn. WHOLE bits must be used, so
if there was for example a 6x9 font, it'd mean only 54 bits = 6.75 bytes must
be used, but this should be stored as 7 bytes, the unused data should be zero.
