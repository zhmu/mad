If any of the OFFSET fields is 0FFFFFFFFh, it means the screen is not within
the file and that it should be blanked out.

After this comes the picture data

Note: This format is perfectly compitable with 2.0. Whenever
[Number of bytes per pixel] is zero, it should be treated as if it was 1.

[Flags] are defined as:
