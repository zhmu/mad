// 31 - GL's name
"I am Greenleaf"
// 32 - GL: Where is he?
"You're in my home. This is a\nbeautiful place, don't you think?"
// 33 - GL: How he got here
"You were attacked and wounded\nby that horrible monster.\nLuckily, I saw you being\nattacked and was able to drive\nit off with my spells. You were\nwounded, so I brought you to my\nhome, where it was safer."
// 34 - GL: Goodbye
"Be careful out there. Goodbye,\nand good luck!"
// 35 - Narrator
You open your eyes to see that\nthe owner of the voice is a\nbeautiful woman. You are lying\nin a forest clearing which is\npermeated with an aura of peace\nand happiness. Realizing that the\nwoman has asked you a question, you\nnod your head in response. She smiles.
// 36 - GL: Ask for more about Greenleaf
"You're an inquisitive\nadventurer, aren't you? I am a\nmage. I have taken on the\nresponsibility of guarding this\nforest. It hasn't been easy,\nconsidering that there are now\ntwo settlements in this valley,\nbut I protect the forest to the\nbest of my ability... Who are\nyou?"
// 37 - GL: Tell about yourself
"So, you're answering a\nproclamation by Duke Conrad\nthat says Albion needs a\nhero? He must be getting\ndesperate if he needs\noutside help. Things are\nworse than I thought... I\nwish you good luck on your\nquest. Is there anything I\ncan tell you that will help\nyou?"
// 38 - GL: About about settlements
"Well, there's Albion and\nHelmsdale. Albion, which\nis named after the valley,\nis the larger of the two;\nit's a town near the\nDuke's castle. Helmsdale\nis a small hamlet nearer\nto the coast."
// 39 - GL: About Albion
"I'm sorry, but I don't\ngo to the town very\noften, so I can't give\nyou any more information."
// 40 - GL: About Helmsdale
"I'm sorry, but I don't\nusually go to the hamlet,\nso I can't tell you\nanything else about\nHelmsdale."
// 41 - GL: About Duke
"Thorn Conrad is the local\nLord. He is supposed to keep\npeace between the inhabitants\nof the\nvalley; Duke Conrad\nis also the commander of the\nguards and is responsible for\nthe valley's defense"
// 42 - GL: About monster
"It was a golem, one\nof many types of\nmonsters that plague\nthis valley. They're\nvery dangerous, you\nshould be more careful."
// 43 - GL: Ask about valley
"This valley is called\nAlbion. A pretty name for\na peaceful, beautiful\nplace... At least, this\nvalley was peaceful until\na while ago, when the\ntrouble started."
// 44 - GL: About trouble
"A few months ago, the monster\npopulation of the valley started\nto increase. Some of the\ncreatures are just natural\ncreatures, predators and the\nlike. Usually the population of\nsuch creatures would be kept at\nsafe levels by Lord Conrad's\nsoldiers but he's been having\ntrouble with a group called the\n"Rogues" and has been unable to\ndeal with the other threats."
// 45 - GL: More about trouble
"Other monsters, however,\nare unnatural and evil...\nThe creature that attacked\nyou is such an example. I\ncan feel the evil magic that\nanimates the golems...\n*schrudder*"
// 46 - GL: About Duke (again! XXX: must do linking, should be able to insert [@41] here)
"Thorn Conrad is the local\nLord. He is supposed to keep\npeace between the inhabitants\nof the\nvalley; Duke Conrad\nis also the commander of the\nguards and is responsible for\nthe valley's defense"
// 47 - GL: About golems
"Golems are magically-\nanimated creaturs\nusually maded out of a\nsingle type of\nsubstance, like wood or\nclay. Someone has been\nmaking them in Albion\nValley; the golems have\nforced many of the\nfarmers to leave. The\nautomatons destroy farms\nand kill anyone who gets\nin their way."
// 48 - GL: Ask about someone
"I've heard that an evil\nwizard to the north of here\nis creating the golems,\nbut I can't tell whether\nthe rumor is correct or not.\nI've never met the wizard\nthe tale mentions."
